## **Setup**
1. Install the plugin into your Minecraft server.  

2. Open your channel's [Twitch Dashboard](https://dashboard.twitch.tv) and create your custom Channel Points Rewards. (optional)
> [!TIP]
>  If needed, you can copy-paste the names of the Channel Points Rewards into a text document for later use.
  
3. Set your [config.yml](core/src/main/resources/config.yml) up. Adjust the settings and setup events for rewards, donations... You will need to link a Twitch account in order to connect use the Twitch API (the linked account **needs to own/moderate all Twitch channels** set in config.yml) There are two ways to link your Twitch account to the plugin:  

    - **Using a key-based authentication** *(recommended)*:  
    You will need a Client ID and Access token. You can get one mannually or through a website as [Twitch Token Generator](https://twitchtokengenerator.com). Make sure to add all the [needed scopes](#twitch-scopes).  
    Uncomment `CUSTOM_CLIENT_ID` and `CUSTOM_ACCESS_TOKEN` on the config file and add your Client ID and Token onto the corresponding fields.  
    Once the server has started you just need to run `/twitch link` and your account will be automatically logged in. You may need to refresh the token when it expires.

    - **Log in through a browser**:  
    You won't need any extra modification in your config.yml file. You will just need to run `/twitch link` in-game and open the provided link. You may need to log in your Twitch account and authorise the app. Once you finish the log in process you can close the browser and your account will be linked.
> [!WARNING]  
> Currently due to API limitations **it's only possible to use the browser method if the login link is opened with the same machine the server is being ran on**. You also have to repeat this process each time you start the server or reload the plugin.

4. Set up permissions for:
    - linking/reloading (`chatpointsttv.manage`).
    - the target player(s) (`chatpointsttv.target`).
    - people you want the reward messages broadcasted to (`chatpointsttv.broadcast`).  

    Â· See [Permissions](#permissions) for more information.

> [!NOTE]
> The config file for the plugin should be in 'plugins/ChatPointsTTV/config.yml'.

## **config.yml docs**
To reset the original configuration, delete `config.yml` and reload the plugin. The file will regenerate automatically.  
*Sections with a (\*) are required to be changed in order to the plugin to be used.*
* **Channel Username***: The channel(s) that will be listened for rewards, bits and subs. (In case of multiple channels, they must be added as a list: `["channel_1", "channel_2", "..."]`)  
* **Auto-Link**: If set to true, it will try to connect automatically to the Twitch API with the provided credentials in `CUSTOM_CLIENT_ID` and `CUSTOM_ACCESS_TOKEN`.  
* **Ignore Offline Streamers**: If set to true, the plugin will only listen to the people who is currently streaming. This also includes chat messages.  
* **Custom Client ID**: Client ID used for key-based authorization. Leave commented if it's not being used.  
* **Custom Access Token**: Access token used for key-based authorization. Leave commented if it's not being used.  
* **Ignore Offline Events**: If enabled, events from offline streamers will be ignored.  
* **Show Chat**: If enabled, your stream chat will be shown in-game to all players in the server.  
* **Chat Blacklist**: List of usernames of chat bots and other users that will be ignored for the in-game stream chat.
* **Channel Point Rewards***: A list containing all **channel point rewards** that you want an action set up. See [Reward Actions](#reward-actions) for more information.  
You need to follow this format: `{REWARD_NAME}: {ACTION}`, replacing `{REWARD_NAME}` with the **exact** reward name that is on Twitch and `{ACTION}` with the desired action to run.  
* **Follow Rewards***: A list with all the actions that will be executed when the channel gets a new follower.
* **Cheer Rewards***: A list containing all **cheer rewards** that you want an action set up. See [Reward Actions](#reward-actions) for more information.  
You need to follow this format: `AMOUNT: {ACTION}`, replacing `AMOUNT` with the minimal ammount of bits that will be needed to trigger the event and `{ACTION}` with the desired action to run.
* **Sub Rewards***: A list containing all **subscription rewards** that you want an action set up. See [Reward Actions](#reward-actions) for more information.  
You need to follow this format: `TWITCH_PRIME/TIER1/TIER2/TIER3: {ACTION}`.  Replace `{ACTION}` with the desired action to run.
* **Gift Rewards***
A list containing all **subscription gifts rewards** that you want an action set up. See [Reward Actions](#reward-actions) for more information.  
You need to follow this format: `AMOUNT: {ACTION}`, replacing `AMOUNT` with the minimal ammount of subscriptions that will be needed to be gifted in order to trigger the event and `{ACTION}` with the desired action to run.
* **Raid Rewards***
A list containing all **raid rewards** that you want an action set up. See [Reward Actions](#reward-actions) for more information.  
You need to follow this format: AMOUNT: {ACTION}, replacing AMOUNT with the minimal ammount of raid viewers that will be needed to trigger the event and {ACTION} with the desired action to run.  
* **Mob Glow**: Whether the spawned mobs should have a glowing effect (highlighted and visible through blocks).
* **Display Name on Mob**: Whether the spawned mobs should have the name of the user who triggered the action.
* **Log Events**: Determines whether all events will be logged. `true` means that all channel point rewards, cheers, subscriptions and gifts will be logged into the console. `false` means that they won't be logged.
* **In-game Alerts Mode***: How will the game notify of an event. Valid options: `chat`, `title`, `all`, `none`. Choosing `none`  will disable In-game alerts.
* **Colors**: Allows you to customize every color of the title messages. Set the wanted strings to any Minecraft Color Name (`RED`, `GOLD`, `DARK_PURPLE`...).  
You can leave this section unmodified, as there are default colors set up in the original file
* **Strings**: Allows you to customize all title texts displayed to people with the `chatpointsttv.broadcast` permission. You may want to translate these strings to your language for a better experience. Don't add spaces before or after the double quotes as the plugin already does this for you. English strings are set up in the file by default.

> [!TIP]
> Argument names surrounded by <> means that it is a required argument.
> Arguments surrounded by [] are optional.

You should set up your events in your config file following this format:
```
TYPE_REWARDS:
    - KEY:
        - Action 1
        - Action 2
        - ...
```
or
```
TYPE_REWARDS:
    - KEY:
        - STREAMER:
            - Action 1
            - Action 2
            - ...

        - default:
            - Action
```
Whereas `TYPE_REWARDS` is replaces with the appropiate config key that is already on the file, `KEY` with the channel points reward name, subscription tier or minimal amount of bits/subs.  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> **You should omit the `KEY` section to add follow rewards** and go straight to the actions. See placeholders on the default [config.yml](core/src/main/resources/config.yml#L41).

> [!TIP]
> You can now target multiple channels. If you do so, you can target some events to a specific channel following the second format. You can still follow the first example if you don't aim to target specific channels. 

You can also use the `{USER}` and `{TEXT}` fields to use data from your events inside of your actions. `{USER}` will be replaced with the chatter's username. `{TEXT}` will be replaced with the text input of the Channel Points Reward.
