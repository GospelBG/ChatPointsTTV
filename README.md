ChatPointsTTV is a Spigot plugin designed to foster interaction between streamers and their audience on Twitch or TikTok LIVE. Set up your own rewards in exchange for engagement on your streams (such as Twitch Channel Points, follows, donations, subscriptions...). Spawn mobs, give items or run any command when an event occurs.  

Possibilities to connect with your audience are endless!
